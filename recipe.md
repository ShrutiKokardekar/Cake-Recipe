Chocolate Cake 
 
 First we take some all purpose flour and mix it with cocoa powder, pinch of salt, baking powder, baking soda and some powdered sugar. Then we will have to take a different bowl and add some melted butter, eggs (optional) and milk. Mix everything slowly so that lumps are not formed. Put the mixture in a baking tray and put it in the oven at 180 degrees for 20-25 minutes. Serve it and enjoy!
